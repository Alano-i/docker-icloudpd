# docker-icloudpd
An Alpine Linux Docker container for iCloud Photos Downloader. I use it for syncing the photo streams of all the iDevices in my house back to my server because it's the only way of backing up multiple devices to a single location. It uses the system keyring to securely store credentials, has HEIC to JPG conversion capability, and can send Telegram, Prowl, Pushover, WebHook, DingTalk, Discord, openhab, IYUU and WeCom notifications.

# Now with 2-way comms via Telegram!

## CONFIGURING ICLOUDPD

The README on Dockerhub has a hard limit of 25,000 characters, and I've hit this limit too many times now. All in all, I'm up at about 35k characters for the documentation, so this README is just a placeholder now. Please see CONFIGURATION.md for infor on how to configure this container. It is available here: https://github.com/boredazfcuk/docker-icloudpd/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md
